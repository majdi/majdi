Yo, I am [Majdi](https://majdi.im), an enthusiast life hacker by day ☼ and a food lover by night ☾<br />
I'm passionate about **code** and mostly work on projects written in **Go**, **Deno** or **Python**.<br />

My journey started at 24 as Head of Studies of a computer school.<br />
Then, I discovered tech ecosystem and ~~failed~~ learned a lot from creating a startup focused on iconography.<br />
Later, I founded [mhirba](https://mhirba.com), a craft studio where I spent couple of years helping startups, schools, and associations.<br />

At the end, I was Head of Tech / Ai Engineering Manager at [bodyguard](https://bodyguard.ai) fighting online toxicity.

Today, I'm a [maker](https://indiepa.ge/majdi) @ [confiture.ai](https://confiture.ai) to push ideas that come in my minds + write [stories](https://substack.com/@majditoumi) about topics that matters... or not.<br />
