Yo, I am [Majdi](https://majdi.im), an enthusiast life hacker by day ☼ and a food lover by night ☾<br />
I'm passionate about **code** and mostly work on projects written in **Go**, **Node** or **Python**.<br />

My journey started at 24 as Head of Studies of a computer school.<br />
Then, I discovered tech ecosystem and ~~failed~~ learned a lot from creating a startup focused on iconography.<br />
Later, I founded mhirba, a craft studio where I spent couple of years helping startups, schools, and associations.<br />

At the end, my only employee exeprience was as Head of Tech / Ai Engineering Manager at bodyguard.ai fighting online toxicity.
