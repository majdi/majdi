Yo, I am [Majdi](https://majdi.im), an enthusiast life hacker by day ☼ and a food lover by night ☾<br />
I'm passionate about **code** and mostly work on projects written in **Go**, **Node** or **Python**.<br />

I define myself as a maker @ [confiture.ai](https://confiture.ai) to push ideas that come in my minds + write [stories](https://confiture.substack.com/) about topics that matters... or not.<br />

My journey started at 24 as Head of Studies of a computer school.<br />
Then, I discovered tech ecosystem and ~~failed~~ learned a lot from creating a startup focused on iconography.<br />
Later, I founded mhirba, a craft studio where I spent couple of years helping startups, schools, and associations.<br />

At the end, I was as Head of Tech / Ai Engineering Manager at bodyguard.ai fighting online toxicity and learn more about data.

Today, I'm actually Ai Engineer at mistral.ai where frontier models meet real product constraints.
